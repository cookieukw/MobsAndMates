# Mobs&Mate

A Minecraft Bedrock Scripting Addon that turns villagers into smart, command-driven companions. Talk to them naturally, assign jobs, and watch them act like real partners — mining, fishing, exploring, and more.

## ✨ Features

- **Natural Commands:** Speak in English or Portuguese, even with typos — villagers understand via fuzzy matching.
- **Smart Conversations:** They confirm who you’re talking to and won’t mix up players in multiplayer.
- **Multilanguage:** Fully localized for English and Brazilian Portuguese(yet).
- **Professions System:** Mining, farming, exploring, fishing, and more.
- **Custom Loots & Timings:** Edit a single config to tweak drops and durations.
- **Multiplayer Ready:** Clean session tracking — each player interacts with their own villager.



## 💬 How to Use

### 1. Name a Villager
Use a Name Tag first. Only named villagers respond.

### 2. Talk to Them
Say their name in chat.

```

> Ruan <Ruan> What do you want me to do?

```

Misspell? No problem — they’ll ask if you meant them.

```

> Runn <Ruan> Are you talking to me?
> yes <Ruan> What do you want me to do?

```

### 3. Give Orders
Once focused, just say what to do.

```

> Ruan <Ruan> What do you want me to do?
> go fishing <Ruan> Alright, getting ready to fish.
